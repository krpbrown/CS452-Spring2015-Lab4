Lab 4

For this lab I modified the textureCube4.html and textureCube4.js files from the Angel directories to fit the purpose of this lab.
I changed the vertices back to that of the random 3D object from my lab 3, the rendering, removed the rotate buttons, and added the arrow key functionality.
I used a texture created in the program to avoid the issues of Chrome not wanting to open other files.
